  - rscadd: New loadout options in Tajara loadout for getting sets of Religious banners
      (S'rand'marr and Ma'ta'ke).
  - spellcheck: Fixed incorrect extended description for Raskariim mask.
  FluffyGhost:
  - bugfix: Fixed some situations where a null was being set as target.
  - refactor: Repathed the dreaded target_mob variable to last_found_target, and from
      mob to atom, as it was not being used only for mobs.
  - refactor: Added procs to set and unset the last_found_target and setup the signals
      relative to clear it, and validations.
  - refactor: Thanks to the above, removed a viewscan that was needed to delete references
      when mobs die from their attacker.
  - code_imp: General QoL of code, DMDocs.
  - server: Updates the CI to use byond 515.1644.
  - bugfix: Fix mechs taking damage from sandstorms.

      similar to Aut'akh limbs.

      facilitate this.
  - bugfix: Pixel-shifted the Vaurca Attendant west-facing head sprites to align properly.
  WickedCybs:
